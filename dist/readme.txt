   4. Precautions
   
Since pasSHA is still in development and it HAS NOT PASSED any user testing
it may have some issues, that may lead to LOSS OF PASSWORDS DATA. In order to
protect yourself from loss of all your passwords it is recommended to do the 
following actions, when all passwords are created or new added.
1) Export all passwords and keep them somewhere safe. This is done by pressing Export button.
2) Make a reserve copy of your (all) .cif file(s) located in /user/ directory.
